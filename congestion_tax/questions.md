1. what is the input format? I have assumed json payload as input
2. what is the output format? I have assumed json response as output
3. what are possible vehicle_types which needs to be supported? I have assumed the same tollfee for all type of vehicles except the exempted vehicle types.
4. What should be the behaviour of this api, when a person drives with invalid vehicle?
